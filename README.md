## Dev setup

### Using devcontainer

If going the dev container route, you will need the following:

- Docker (cli, but optionally the desktop app)
- VSCode, and the `Dev Containers` extension
- `ssh` installed on the host machine, to access git from within

After cloning the repo, you will need to open it in VSCode and run the following command:

- `Cmd + Shift + P -> Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

## Simualations

The demo simulation here is derived from `mesa-geo`'s [Rainfall Model](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/tree/main/gis/rainfall).
