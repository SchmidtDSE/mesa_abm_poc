## Logging Configuration

Logging is configurable within the simulation using the following workflow.


#### Logging Pattern

First, find a reasonable location to trigger a log event - this should be associated with a particular model 'event', whether it occurs to the `agent` or to the `sim` itself. For eg, the `sim` will 'experience' a step, and during that step, each `agent` will make a step - but we likely want to log different things at the time of an agent step and a sim step.

Accordingly, at the top of `vegetation/config/logging.py`, we define a events as:

```

class AgentEventType(Enum):
    ON_CREATE = "on_create"
    ON_STEP = "on_step"
    ON_SURVIVE = "on_survive"
    ON_DEATH = "on_death"
    ON_TRANSITION = "on_transition"
    ON_DISPERSE = "on_disperse"


class SimEventType(Enum):
    ON_START = "on_start"
    ON_STEP = "on_step"
    ON_END = "on_end"
    ON_MANAGE = "on_manage"

```

We will use these later on to determine the format, flavor, and logging level of the log message we issue when the given event occurs. 

#### JSON Configuration

For each particular logging event defined, we have a representative key / value entry within `vegetation/config/logging_config.json`. For eg, for the event `AgentEventType.ON_SURVIVE`, we have defined:

```json
{
    "agent": {
        "JoshuaTreeAgent": {
            "on_survive": "{STD_INDENT}ðŸ’ª Agent {agent.unique_id} survived! ({agent.life_stage} w/ survival rate {survival_rate:.2f})",
        ...
    },
    "sim": ...
}
```

Note that in this example we added `...` to signify the rest of the json config for the other event types, for clarity. 

There are a couple of conventions we assume (logic defined by `vegetation/config/logging.py`). These log strings will be passed to `string.format` with some custom logic - any variables defined within curly braces will be obtained in one of two ways:

- First, if they are a single variable name with no `.` within the variable (for eg `survival_rate`), the logger will expect to be passed this variable within a keyword argument defined in `context` dict (more on that below).

- If the variable contains a `.` - for eg `agent.life_stage`, this will be assumed to be obtained from within the agent method where the logging is triggered. The logging event has access to the agent object by default, so these don't need to be passed in `context` - but they do need to exist as a valid attribute within the `agent` class (for example, `agent.life_stage` must be valid and existing).

    - _For now, this only works one level deep and doesn't support execution - for eg, `agent.indices.min_index` or `agent.indices[0]` or `int(agent.life_stage)` or similar will not work. We could investigate this if it seems useful_, though.

- We also arbitrarily define some useful constants: `STD_INDENT`, `WIDE_INDENT`, `VERY_WIDE_INDENT` - these are also defined in `vegetation/config/logging.py`. This is nice because we can change the indent size globally across all logs in one spot, for eg, but might also be useful for other 'constants' that don't rely on agent state or application logic really. These can be readily ignored in favor of hard-coding spaces or tabs for example, but this logic is set up in case it proves useful. 

#### Triggering a Log

The agent(s) and simulation both have their own loggers - `agent_logger` and `sim_logger`, respectively. These can be accessed at any point to issue a log event according to the event type passed along, as follows:

```
self.agent_logger.log_agent_event(
    self,
    AgentEventType.ON_SURVIVE,
    context={"survival_rate": survival_rate},
)
```

Using this method call, the `agent_logger` will grab the appropriate log method defined in `logging_config.json`, according to the log event type (here `AgentEventType.ON_SURVIVE`), and pass along the agent itself (here, `self`, since this method is triggered from within the agent class method `on_step`) and any additional context necessary (here `survival_rate`, since this is ephemeral and not stored by the agent - but do we want to log it, so we pass it for just this log event).

## Model Run Artifact Structure

We save model runs as `zarr` data structures according to the following approach.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ root
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hash_A
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 0.0.100 (x, y, timestep, replicate)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.0.100
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hash_B
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 0.0.100 (x, y, timestep, replicate)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.0.100
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

Hashing logic will create a unique hash key from a `JSON` / Dict created using all releveant parameters for a particular simulation (and potentially a hash of the commit used to create the sims, if we are not done with our config logic?). For eg:

TODO: formatting to make sure 0.05 and 0.050 are not different
TODO: make robust to manual (non-hash) names
TODO: Talk with ben or other NPS collaborators about RAD Coarsening logic


`hash_A`
```
{
    "seed_emergence_rate": 0.05,
    "jotr_breeding_age": 30
}
```

`hash_B`
```
{
    "seed_emergence_rate": 0.15,
    "jotr_breeding_age": 30
}
```

Repeated model runs of `hash_A` will be added to the `hash_A` subgroup within the zarr sub-group as additional replicates. If model config changes (a new key is added, or an existing key is removed, or the name / value of a key is changed), the hash will change and thus a new subgroup will be greated according to that new hash key. Then, the first model replicate will be saved as replicate 0 within that subgroup, appending there-after for additional replicates. 

Questions:
- Which dimensions are we most interested in aggregating regularly?
    - all replicates at a particular timestep and param hash, potentially ignoring x, y? (for aggregations of tipping points - this is probably the one to optimize)
    - one simulation across all time, keeping x, y? (for visualization - probably ok if this one is slow)
- Outputs - what do we want to actually show at the end of of a suite of model run?
    - sensitivity analysis - which parameters are important for emergent outcomes
